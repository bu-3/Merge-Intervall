# Merge-Intervall
A little desktop tool to merge overlapping intervals from a list. The desktop tool is built with Windows Forms and includes a graphical user interface to make it more fancy and easier to use.

## How it works
Entries within the list look like this:
`[1,4][4,6][15,25][12,15][7,9][8,11]`

And the result from the list above should look like this:
`[1, 6][12, 25][7, 11]`
